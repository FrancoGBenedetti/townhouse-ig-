						Townhouse IG is a family-owned real estate investment firm focused on the needs of home
						town America. We deliver a single low-risk plan that can help lay the foundation for a brighter future.
						All it takes to get started is $50,000 dollars and a phone call to one of our knowledgeable
						representatives.
						We’re a company that treats your money like our own and our customers like family. We don’t risk it on
						the stock market and we never invest it in a project we don’t 100-percent believe in. Townhouse IG also
						operates with 100-percent transparency and never resorts to asterisks or fine print. What you read is
						what you get: 12.5-percent returns in just 12 months—minus taxes and fees.
						Our family has decades of experience in construction and real estate—and, up until now, has relied on
						family investors to get the job done. With 6 profitable projects under our belt, we decided to open the
						door to any American dreaming of a better future. But, we’re not just a family-owned constructionbusiness. We’re one headed by a chairman with more than 10 years of accounting and finance
						experience.
						So, if you’re tired of riding the Wall Street rollercoaster, consider giving us a call. Put your trust in
						Townhouse IG.
